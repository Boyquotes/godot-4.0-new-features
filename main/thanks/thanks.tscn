[font_size=24]
We had so many things to show that we couldn't possibly have them all completely ready in time.

So, there's a little more to discover in the project's files!

Here are some additional interesting bits:

- in [b]additional/custom_resources[/b], you'll find demonstration of custom resource exports, grouped exports, auto-generation documentation, and generally the new inspector panel and export features
- in [b]additional/POT_generation[/b], we explains how to generate POT (translation) files
- in [b]additional/snippets[/b], you'll find a good number of examples of the new GDScript features and syntax
- in [b]2d_particles[/b], there's an additional rainy scene
- in [b]networking[/b], you'll find no less than 6 different network  architectures, which we tried to keep as simple as we could, demonstrating different possible setups.

Those demos were made by the GDQuest team, but we didn't do it alone; were greatly helped by:

- Fales
- Paulloz
- Tokage
- iFire
- Smix8
- Calinou
